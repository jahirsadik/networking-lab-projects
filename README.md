# Networking Lab Projects

This repository contains two main projects developed as part of my networking lab course. The projects demonstrate different networking concepts, protocols, and tools.

## Project Overview

The repository is organized into two main folders:

### Iterative DNS Client

This folder contains a Python implementation of an iterative DNS client. The client queries DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses. It demonstrates the DNS resolution process and how multiple servers can be queried iteratively until a response is obtained.

### Simple Web Proxy Client with Caching

This folder includes a simple web proxy client built in Python. It caches responses to improve performance and reduce load times. The proxy client handles HTTP requests, forwards them to the target server, and returns the response while caching for future requests.

## Conclusion

These projects illustrate my understanding of networking principles and their practical applications.
